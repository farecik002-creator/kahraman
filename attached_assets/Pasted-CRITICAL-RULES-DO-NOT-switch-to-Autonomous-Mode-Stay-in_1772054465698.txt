CRITICAL RULES:

DO NOT switch to Autonomous Mode.
Stay in manual mode.
Do NOT refactor the project.
Do NOT change folder structure.
Do NOT rename files.
Do NOT change backend.
Do NOT modify core mechanics.
Do NOT alter damage formulas.
Do NOT change combo logic calculation.
Do NOT touch navigation.
Do NOT rewrite state management.

The game mechanics must remain EXACTLY the same.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — FIX PREVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

The preview currently shows “Something went wrong”.

Without changing the project structure,
find the root cause and fix it.

Do not ask for instructions.
Do not change architecture.
Solve it safely and minimally.

Preview must load successfully before continuing.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — AAA VISUAL & ANIMATION UPGRADE
--------------------------------------------------

Only improve visuals and animation layers.
Attach animations AFTER logic triggers.
Never modify core gameplay logic.

-------------------------
1) GRID IMPROVEMENT
-------------------------

- Grid must be 6x6.
- Grid height must align visually with character height.
- Grid expands downward until HP/MP bars.
- No logic changes allowed.

Tile visual upgrade:
- Soft gradient
- Inner glow
- Subtle outer glow
- Rounded corners
- Premium 3D feel
- Soft drop shadow
- Slight hover/press scale animation
- Smooth spawn animation

-------------------------
2) TILE DROP PHYSICS
-------------------------

When tiles fall:
- Smooth translateY animation
- Ease-out curve
- 220–300ms duration
- Slight bounce at end (subtle)
- No logic change

-------------------------
3) MATCH IMPACT EFFECT
-------------------------

On match:
- Scale up 1.1
- Glow flash
- Fade out
- Micro screen shake (very subtle)
- 150–200ms timing

-------------------------
4) 4-TILE COMBO EFFECT
-------------------------

When combo count == 4:
- Create particle energy stream
- Energy flows from matched tiles
- Moves toward character
- Smooth bezier motion
- Tile-color based energy

-------------------------
5) 5-TILE COMBO EFFECT
-------------------------

When combo count >= 5:
- Stronger glow
- Larger particle stream
- Character glow pulse
- Slight slow-motion effect (very short 120ms)
- Strong color-based energy burst

-------------------------
6) COLOR-BASED ENERGY SYSTEM
-------------------------

Red → Red flame energy
Green → Nature aura
Blue → Ice/arcane energy
Purple → Dark magic aura
Yellow → Golden radiant burst

Energy particles:
- Small glowing circles
- Fade while traveling
- Smooth easing
- No new gameplay effect
- Purely visual

-------------------------
7) CHARACTER REACTION
-------------------------

When energy reaches character:
- Soft outline glow
- 1.05 scale pulse
- Short light burst
- 150ms duration
- No stat changes

-------------------------
8) HP / MP BAR POLISH
-------------------------

- Smooth animated width transition
- Slight glow on change
- Subtle gradient fill
- No value logic change

-------------------------
9) PERFORMANCE SAFETY
-------------------------

- No heavy libraries
- No new major dependencies
- Use existing animation system
- Keep performance smooth
- Test after each step

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL RULE:

Game mechanics must remain EXACTLY the same.
Only visuals, animation layers, and polish are allowed.
Preview must work.
Stay in manual mode.
Work step by step.
